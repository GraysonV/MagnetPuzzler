# Magnet Puzzler
## By Grayson Verspeek
### Info
Magnet Puzzler is a game about a magnet and a puzzle. It was forged in the depths of Code Ninjas for the specific purpose of creating a game for Black Belt and involves matching four colored projectiles together to score points.

### Why a puzzle game?
You ask me. It's not even my favorite genre. I do really like playing games like Tetrisâ„¢ when I'm bored though.

### Play online?
You can go to the Itch.io page for the game to play it in the web browser: [https://grayson-v.itch.io/magnet-puzzler](https://grayson-v.itch.io/magnet-puzzler)

### 02/05/2025 Update: NO MORE AI LETS FLIPPING GOOOO!!!
When I first made this game back in 2023, AI-Generated art imagery was this crazy new thing that I thought offered a bunch of interesting applications when it came to making game assets and thought that the surreal look that Stable Diffusion generated was a very interesting style I wanted to incorporate into the background images of the game. Now in 2025, I want nothing to do with generative AI so I've made a new version of Magnet Puzzler that replaces the backgrounds with custom 90's-esque CGI I made myself in Blender. Does it capture the same vibe? That's debatable but at least it's 1000%  more human than the original images.
