# Magnet Puzzler
## By Grayson Verspeek
### Info
Magnet Puzzler is a game about a magnet and a puzzle. It was forged in the depths of Code Ninjas for the specific purpose of creating a game for Black Belt and involves matching four colored projectiles together to score points.

### Why a puzzle game?
You ask me. It's not even my favorite genre. I do really like playing games like Tetrisâ„¢ when I'm bored though.
